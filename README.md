Created  a motion capturing torso that uses flex sensors, accelero-meters, and in the future gyroscopes to capture motion of the upper body and display that data in real-time on a web app using firebase. Future applications for this could be physical therapy and increased immersion for virtual reality, where the VR takes in the motion of the person as well.
